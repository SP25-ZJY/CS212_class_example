## `Instructions`
Participation can take many forms, many of which professors cannot observe. 
- 🔴 Each month, update monthly participation portfolio, commit, and push it on class example.

| Month    | Due     |
|----------|---------|
| Jan      | Jan, 31 |
| Feb      | Feb, 28 |
| Mar      | Mar, 31 |
| Apr      | Apr, 29 |
| Over All | Apr, 29 |

- ➡️ Much of your participation grade will be based on your portfolio.

## `What counts as participation?`

### `Engagement with course materials`
- Making a comment/answering a question in class.
- Contributing to small group discussions.
- Being a small group spokesperson.
- Discussing course material with friends and family outside of class.
- Posing a good idea or question to Discord or answering one there.

### `Community building`
- Active listening (demonstrating that you are listening in class through body language and note taking). 
  - Students should actively listen to the professor and each other.
- Using each other’s names in class.
- Building off each other’s class comments.
- Demonstrating respect and openness for each other during class.

## `⏺️ What does not count as participation? ⏺️`
- Attendance does not count towards participation.
- Attendance is a **pre-condition** for participation.
- Therefore, if you are not attending or miss many classes, your participation will suffer.
